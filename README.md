### Description

This is a command line version of the port scanner that I have used in Frankinal 2. The useage is, cline_portscanner.exe <ipaddress>,<start port>,<stop port>,<timout (ms)>

As you can see from the screenshot it includes a pause and stop button and also a thread timout slider so you can actually change the timeout in milleseconds whilst it scans. Which is nice. I hope you like it. Please comment on it, and if you like it download Frankinal 2 from this site as that enables you to double click on the open ports and instantly connect to them, wonderful!! Votes wouldnt go un-noticed either!
